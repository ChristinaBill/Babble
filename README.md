Babble Game

This is the Java final project for Software Development II.  

A single-player ("solitaire") take on the game of Scrabble.  
Conceptually, the player tries to make words from a random set of seven letters (called "Tiles").  
Each time the player makes a valid word, they score points based on the letters they used.

The seven letters the player can arrange into a word are stored on a tile rack.  
When a valid word is completed, its tiles are removed from the tile rack and randomly replenished from the remaining letters in a tile bag.

The tile bag initially contains a set of tiles based on the letters and points in the standard English Scrabble distribution.  
(Ignore the two blank tiles.) When the bag is empty, the game is over.
